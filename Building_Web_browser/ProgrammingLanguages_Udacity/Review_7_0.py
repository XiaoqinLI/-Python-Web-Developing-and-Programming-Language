For more information:

    Learning theory (i.e., a theory of how we learn) often comes up in education. The computer science equivalent is computational learning theory.
    Overfitting, in which one constructs a model that is very complex relative to the observations, is a problem in both statistics and also in machine learning.

"""
Dave Herman talks about security and languages at Mozilla. One key concept is the trusted computing base, which we want to be as small as possible. Languages like C++ admit buffer overflows, a source of security exploits. The halting problem prevents us from perfectly detecting malicious code or webpages statically.

For more information:

    Computer security is a critical area in computer science.

# List Comprehensions

# Write a short Python program that for all numbers x between 0 and 99 prints

To spice up the quiz, we introduce the function reduce (also known as fold).
